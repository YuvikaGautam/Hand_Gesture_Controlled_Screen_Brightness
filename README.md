# Hand_Gesture_Controlled_Screen_Brightness
This repository contains a Python script that uses the OpenCV library and the Mediapipe framework to control screen brightness using hand gestures. 
The script captures video from your webcam, detects hand landmarks, calculates the distance between two specific finger landmarks, and adjusts the screen brightness accordingly
